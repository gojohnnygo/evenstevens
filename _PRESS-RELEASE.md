## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  Even Stevens is an app that helps you fairly split bills between large parties. No more round robin questioning on who had what. It's all there for you everyone to see and interact with. Claim what you owe. They know.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  We've all been there. We've been at a large dinner party having fun and the bill comes. There are two options: 1.) Split the bill evenly to keep it simple and anlienate your friends who had soup and water. 2.) Tediously calculate who had what. In either situation, someone is overpaying...or under paying.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Just snap a pic and send a message. All parties iteract with the receipt at the same time. Interactive receipts give everyone the ease of selecting they owe including tax and tip.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "Even Stevens, keeping everything even...as in fair...not even as in equal, because that's what we're trying to solve."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  1. Download app.
  2. Eat your dinner.
  3. Take a picture of your receipt.
  4. Send the interactive receipt to your friends.
  5. Resolve the bill.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "I used to avoid large dinners because I've been burned one too many times. I didn't have any friends. Then I heard about this great app and now I'm eating out every night with friends!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  At the end of the night, after appetizers, after the entrees, and after the desserts, you'll be glad you went Even, Even Stevens.
